    <h1>The background-attachment Property</h1>

    <p>
      The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image
      should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong>
      If you do not see any scrollbars, try to resize the browser window.
